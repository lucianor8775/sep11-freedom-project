### Content
the tool that I have decided on for my freedom project is the tool named [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/).
I have decided to use this tool for my freedom project because I am working with another person to create a game with my partner Aaron that incorporates hangman and music. I am very excited because it is my first time working alongside another person and I have high hopes for the finished product. 
```
loadSound("bgm", "assets/music/bgm.mp3")

// Because browsers block autoplay, wait for a click first
onClick(() => {
  play("bgm", {
    loop: true,   // repeat forever
    volume: 0.5,  // half volume
  })
  add([
    text("Music is playing 🎵", { size: 24 }),
    pos(24, 24),
  ])
})

add([
  text("Click anywhere to play music", { size: 24 }),
  pos(24, 24),
])
</script>
```
In this short snippet of code I am allowed to upload a soundfile and it plays whenever the user clicks on the screen and it loops the song.

### Engineering Design Process
I have not yet started to develop my product I am still in the process of researching and figering out how to turn my vision into reality. I am a bit delayed in the process of creating my project due to the fact that I switched tools and changed my mind about the type of project that I would like to do for my freedom project. I will soon begin to map out my vision for my website and start to communicate with my partner on the coding process and what we would like to do with the website.

### Sources
Throughout my research process a few sources that I have used include [kaboom](kaboom.com) which has helped me with doing my research by showing me example code and how to use components, assets, events etc in order to learn more about kaboom. Another resource I used while researching was [Google](google.com) I used Google to fact-check my code and to make sure that I wasnt confusing myself with  different topics/websites. Another resource that I made use of was AI, more specifically [Chatgpt](chatgpt.com) I used chatgpt to break down concepts and things that I was confused about.

### Skills 
A few skills that I improved include the following:
* researching
* communicating
  
I have improved the skill of research by making use of my resources and asking others around me for help when I need help.
I have improved the skill of communication by communicating with my partner Aaron on our project I did this by speaking with him about things that we did not agree on, things that we were very confused on and things we did not talk about enough.
